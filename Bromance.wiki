==Bromance in the media==
Surprisingly, the subject of heterosexual male-male guy likes guy stories have caught on in the media in the 2000s. MTV made a television series entitled ''Bromance'' which is a "tongue-in-cheek skein" with the usual dating series conventions like in ABC's reality-show program ''The Bachelor''.<ref name=twsMAR12a>{{cite news

TV star Ryan Seacrest has admitted to having had bromantic relationships:
{{quote|I can speak from experience -- girls can come and go, but a 'bromance' can last forever. -- Ryan Seacrest.<ref name=twsMAR12a/>}}

Other media projects have emphasized the theme of brotherly love, such as movies like ''Superbad'' and ''Knocked Up'' which feature "straight male pals" bonding.<ref name=twsMAR12a/> In ''Superbad'', after a night of "wacky hijinks, the two lads wind up in sleeping bag together exchanging intimacies with each other;<ref name=twsMAR12e> after a drunken exchange, one of the characters tells his buddy:
{{quote|I just love you. I just wanna go to the rooftops and scream, 'I love my best friend, Evan!'<ref name=twsMAR12c/>}}
But ''Time Magazine'' critic Richard Corliss didn't like the whole idea of films focusing on the subject of love between men in a bromance, and used the term "closet-gay" to describe these films:
{{quote|I guess I have to say that, like most other liberal New York heterosexuals I'm a card-carrying homophiliac; so in calling the films closet-gay, I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It just strikes me as a dominant trend in the year's comedies...<ref name=twsMAR12e/>}}

The movie ''I love you, man'' was a comedy featuring an intense bromance between two men, in which they make up in time for one of the men to get married to his female fiancee. Critic David Edelstein from ''NPR'' explained the movie's premise:
{{quote|I Love You, Man takes an over-familiar premise and inverts it. In Judd Apatow movies like Knocked Up, a child-man enters into a grown-up relationship with a woman and has to face up to adult responsibilities — which means balancing buddydom and domesticity, a classic theme since Diner. The gimmick here is a protagonist, Peter Klaven, played by Paul Rudd, who's slightly effeminate, mature to a fault, engaged to a woman, and who doesn't have close male friends — which won't make for much of a swinging bachelor party. He needs what the movie calls "man dates."<ref name=twsMAR12h45>{{cite news

|title= David Brooks' Barack Obama Bromance: Inside The Unlikely Situation
|quote= These days, the center-right Brooks frequently seems more sympathetic toward Obama than the liberal Paul Krugman. He has written columns praising Obama's Afghanistan policy, education proposals, and economic team. Even on broad areas of disagreement--deficit spending, the sprawling stimulus bill, health care reform--Brooks tends to treat Obama and his administration with respect. "My overall view," Brooks told me, "is ninety-five percent of the decisions they make are good and intelligent. Whether I agree with them specifically, I think they're very serious and very good at what they do." It is an odd situation to say the least: David Brooks, prominent conservative, has become the most visible journalistic ally of arguably the most liberal president of his lifetime.

==Historical roots==
[[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] classical description of friendship is  often taken to be the prototype of the bromance. He wrote around 300 BCE, "It is those who desire the good of their friends for the friends' sake that are most truly friends, because each loves the other for what he is, and not for any incidental quality." Writer Peter Hartlaub in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' wondered whether Aristotle had a ''man-crush'' on his teacher and fellow [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]].<ref name=twsMAR12k23>{{cite news

|accessdate= 2010-03-08
}}</ref> Hartlaub described the sense of a "man-crush":
{{quote|Man Crush -- the completely non-sexual feelings that develop when one heterosexual male finds another dude to be so cool that Guy No. 1 wants to spend as much time as possible with Guy No. 2. [[Aristotle]] had a Man Crush on [[Plato]]. Richie Cunningham had a Man Crush on the Fonz. And for the entire month of April and part of May, everyone in the Bay Area with a Y chromosome had a Man Crush on Golden State Warriors star Baron Davis. The Man Crush has always been a delicate subject among straight men, with a very complicated rule set. It's considered OK to spontaneously proclaim your love for an NFL quarterback when he just scored a touchdown. It's not cool to point out that Bob from human resources always looks nice in that blue sweater. It's socially acceptable to have a poster of a shirtless and sweaty James Hetfield from Metallica on your wall, but never a half-naked or even fully clothed picture of Orlando Bloom. But we're at a crucial point in Man Crush history, where a perfect storm of events could make it possible for even the most insecure guy to proclaim his undying like for his fellow man.<ref name=twsMAR12k23/>}}

There are examples of famous intense male friendships throughout most of Western history and such relationships were likewise common. It has been posited that in the late 19th century, [[Freudianism]] and the emergence of visible homosexuality directed heterosexual men to avoid expressions of intense affection.

Research into friendship and masculinity has found that recent generations of men, raised by feminist mothers in the 1970s, are more emotionally open and more expressive. There is also less concern among men at the notion of being identified as [[homosexual|gay]] and so men are more comfortable exploring deeper friendships with other men.<ref>{{cite news

Another factor believed to influence bromance is that men are marrying later. According to a 2007 study conducted by the [[Rutgers University]] National Marriage Project, the average age of a man's first marriage is 27, up from 23 in 1960. It was also found that men with more education are waiting until their 30s before getting married.<ref name = herestobromance /> The financial pressure of staying single longer may lead to men becoming roommates for extended periods, promoting bromance.

==Gay-straight bromances==

While the term has generally been applied to straight relationships, mixed gay-straight relationships have also been dubbed bromances.
