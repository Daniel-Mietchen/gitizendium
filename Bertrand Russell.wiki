'''Bertrand Russell''' (1872-1970) was a British-born analytic philosopher, essayist and political activist. His primary philosophical work was in mathematical philosophy, where he argued that mathematics could be reduced to logic ([[logicism]]). Russell was also imprisoned for his opposition to the [[First World War]], and was the founding member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]].

Russell wrote voluminously, including a lengthy ''History of Western Philosophy'', essays on his attitude to religion including ''Sceptical Essays'' and ''Why I Am Not A Christian'' (a talk given in 1927 at Battersea Town Hall).
