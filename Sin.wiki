A '''sin''' is an immoral act or omission considered by [[Christianity|Christians]] and other religious people to be against divine law, or offending God. It is used more widely to refer to immoral acts, but the origin comes from the story of the Fall in the Book of [[Genesis]]. For the religious, there are many different teachings about sin - the idea of [[original sin]], the difference between [[venial sin]] and [[mortal sin]], the idea stemming from [[liberation theology]] and others of [[social sin]] and the idea of the unforgivable or [[eternal sin]]. For Christians, [[Jesus Christ]] is generally held to have [[atonement|atoned]] for sin, both original and personal.
