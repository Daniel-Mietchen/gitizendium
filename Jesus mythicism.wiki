'''Jesus mythicism''' is, put simply, the position that Jesus Christ was not a historical figure, but a mythic figure much like King Arthur or Prometheus. Early Christians - including the Gnostics and Marcionites - constructed the Jesus figure out of a variety of sources. Different mythicists point to different parallels: the dying and rising gods [[Osiris]] and [[Adonis]], ideas from mystery religions including [[Mithraism]] and from Indian ideas about [[Krishna]].

The Jesus mythicist position can be traced back to the nineteenth century with the work of the historian [[Bruno Bauer]] and the Dutch radical theological school. More recently, Jesus mythicism has been advocated by scholars including [[Earl Doherty]], [[Robert M. Price]], "Acharya S" and [[George Albert Wells]]. In 2005, Jesus mythicism was the subject of a controversial anti-religious film called ''[[The God Who Wasn't There]]''.

Needless to say, Jesus mythicism has not been widely accepted by the theological establishment or the historical community, and is considered quite toxic to Christian belief.
