'''eXtensible Markup Language''' ('''XML''') is a [[W3C]] markup language derived from [[SGML]] (ISO8879) used in a wide variety of applications for the storage and representation of textual data.

== Usage Examples ==
=== Data Storage ===
==== Address Book Example ====

Suppose Thomas wants to write a simple address book program that stores his addresses and phone numbers in a simple structured manner. He decides his best option is to use XML to store his information because he can define what information he wishes to store. XML works best when the information has a hierarchical arrangement, so Thomas designs the '''schema''' of how his information will be held.

*Person or Company Name
**Addresses
***Mailing Address
***E-mail Address
**Phone Numbers
***Fax Number
***Cell/Mobile Number
**Note

This arrangement of data is then transformed into XML, one possible arrangement is below:

<pre>
<?xml version="1.0">
<person name="Thomas Paine">
    <addresses>
        <mailing>812 Juniper Road</mailing>
        <email>tpaine@foo.net</email>
    <telephone>
        <primary>987-654-4321</primary>
        <fax>555-555-5555</fax>
        <cell>123-456-7890</cell>
    <note>Me.</note>
</person>
</pre>
