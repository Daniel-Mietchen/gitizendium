'''Biology''' is the [[science]] of [[life]]. Biologists study all aspects of living things, including all of the many life forms on earth and the processes in these organisms that enable life. . These basic processes include the making and harnessing of energy, the creation and duplication of the materials that make up the body, the healing of injuries, the reproduction of the organism and many other activities.. 

Life forms have been of interest to all peoples throughout history. Curiosity about the human body and about the bodies of plants and animals is present in every human society. Much of the interest in living things stems from a wish to better exploit natural resources and to improve health. Detailed knowledge about plants and animals has improved people's standard of living through agriculture and animal husbandry, but not all plant and animal lore is biologic science. Biology differs from simple interest in plants, animals and our own bodies by using a systematic approach to study that incorporates an understanding of mathematics, physics, chemistry and the other sciences.

Biology asks some of same questions found in religion and philosophy, questions such as "How did life begin?", and "What features seperate something that is alive from something that is not alive?". The biologist approaches these questions using the scientific method.

There are many independent scientific fields that make up Biology, and all are related.[[ Natural History]], (the study of individual species like white-tailed deer, sugar maple trees, and timber wolves) was one of the first areas of biology to develop. In natural history, whole organisms are studied in an attempt to make sense of the order of Nature. When the natural history of plants and animals are considered in a context of how each affects the other and their environment, then the biologist's focus is on [[ecology]]. Some fields of biology are focused on the natural history of living organisms and their interactions within a certain realm of the earth, as in marine biology, and other fields of biology focus on characteristics of the bodies of living organisms, like the structure ([[Anatomy]] )and function ([[Physiology)]] of body parts. Biologic studies of animals fall under the field of[[ zoology]], where as the biologic study of plants is [called [botany]]. Many of the distinct academic disciplines that make up the field of biology are listed at the bottom of this article along with a brief description. Further information about each is provided through links to other articles within CZ.  

==History of the word "biology"==
Formed by combining the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{Polytonic|βίος}}'' ''(bios)'', meaning 'life', and ''{{Polytonic|λόγος}}'' ''(logos)'', meaning 'study of', the word "biology" in its modern sense seems to have been introduced independently by [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]] (''Biologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'', [[1802]]) and by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (''Hydrogéologie'', 1802). The word itself is sometimes said to have been coined in [[1800]] by Karl Friedrich Burdach, but it appears in the title of Volume 3 of Michael Christoph Hanov's ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae dogmaticae'': ''Geologia, biologia, phytologia generalis et dendrologia'', published in [[1766]].

==History of Biology==

The natural history of plants and animals was the first area of biology to develop. A workable classification of living things was made practical by Linneas using a form of systematic nomenclature he invented.
