'''Biology''' is the [[science]] of [[life]]. Biologists study living things, and most importantly, study the processes in organisms that enable life. These processes include the making and harnessing of energy, the creation and duplication of the materials that make up the body, and the healing of injuries. 

Life forms have been of interest to all peoples throughout history. Biology differs from a simple interest in plants, animals and our own bodies by using a systematic approach to study. The natural history of plants and animals was the first area of biology to develop. Whole organisms were studied in an attempt to make sense of the order of Nature. 

A workable classification of living things was made practical by Linneas using a form of systematic nomenclature he invented.

==History of the word "biology"==
Formed by combining the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{Polytonic|βίος}}'' ''(bios)'', meaning 'life', and ''{{Polytonic|λόγος}}'' ''(logos)'', meaning 'study of', the word "biology" in its modern sense seems to have been introduced independently by [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]] (''Biologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'', [[1802]]) and by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (''Hydrogéologie'', 1802). The word itself is sometimes said to have been coined in [[1800]] by Karl Friedrich Burdach, but it appears in the title of Volume 3 of Michael Christoph Hanov's ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae dogmaticae'': ''Geologia, biologia, phytologia generalis et dendrologia'', published in [[1766]].
