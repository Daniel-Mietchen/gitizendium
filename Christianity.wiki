'''Christianity''' is the largest [[religion]] in the world, with over two billion adherents, and is made up of a large set of traditions originating in first-century [[Palestine]] with the philosophy and teachings of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] (or Yeshua) Christ. As an historical and theological offspring of [[Judaism]], the [[early Christianity|early Christian community]] incorporated the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] into their [[Bible]] and the relationship between the Jewish and Christian traditions remains complex and multifaceted. Christianity is a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] faith that teaches that [[God]] is made up of three [[person]]s sharing a single essence (this teaching is known as [[Trinitarianism]]), and that His will for the world has been revealed in the Bible, a book made up of [[Books of the Bible|several dozen]] pieces of literature composed over 2,000 years in the [[Ancient Near East]].

==Denominational taxonomy==
Christianity has developed into a variety of traditions and ecclesiastical bodies over the past 2,000 years. The broadest division is between [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]], two families that come from historical differences between the [[Latin language|Latin]]-speaking [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Eastern traditions are made up of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], two associations of national churches in [[communion]] (although not with one another) and the much smaller [[Assyrian Church of the East]], whose leadership lives among the [[Assyrian diaspora]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States of America]]. The Western faiths trace their heritage through direct descent, [[Reformation|reform]], or [[Mission|missionizing]] to the [[Rome|Roman]] church and included [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], and [[Anglicanism]]. In addition, there are hundreds of millions of independent Christians - many in the United States; [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement has been influential; and the [[People's Republic of China]] - that have a legacy of some Protestant history, but are not formally associated with a church authority. [[Eastern Rite|Some churches]] from the East have formally joined the Catholic faith, and are historically and culturally Eastern, but ecclesiastically Western. Additionally, there are some movements - such as [[Messianic Judaism]] or [[Christian anarchism]] - which eschew these distinctions, and are based on a  radical interpretation of [[early Christianity]].

[[Protestantism]] is not a single church body or set of formally-related organizations, but a grouping of various church families whose history extends to the [[Reformation]] in 16th century [[Europe]]. Certain pre-Reformation groups are frequently included in discussions about Protestantism, such as [[Waldensians]] and [[Moravians]], who are legacies of reformation movements lead by [[Peter Waldo]] in 12th-century [[Italy]] and [[Jan Hus]] in 15th-century [[Bohemia]]. Some classification systems also include Anglicans as well, as the [[Church of England]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] ceased to be in communion roughly concurrent with the Reformation.
