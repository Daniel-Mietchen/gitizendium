'''Christianity''' is the largest [[religion]] in the world, with over two billion adherents,<ref name="isbn0195079639 ">{{cite book |author=Johnson, Todd M.; Barrett, David B.; Kurian, George Thomas |title=World Christian encyclopedia: a comparative survey of churches and religions in the modern world |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0195079639 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> and is made up of a large set of traditions originating in first-century Palestine with the philosophy and teachings of [[Jesus Christ]]. As an historical and theological offspring of [[Judaism]], the early Christian community incorporated the Jewish scriptures into their [[Bible]] and the relationship between the Jewish and Christian traditions remains complex and multifaceted. Christianity is a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] faith that teaches that [[God]] is made up of three persons sharing a single essence (this teaching is known as [[Trinitarianism]]), and that His will for the world has been revealed in the Bible, a book made up of several dozen pieces of literature composed over 2,000 years.

==Theology==
Christian theology centers around several main beliefs. Christianity is monotheistic; that is, Christians believe in one God, who is in 3 persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost). Christians believe that Jesus was both fully human, and fully divine. Christianity asserts that God is ethically perfect, or holy, and that God is immutable; that is, God does not change<ref> Theologians quote James 1:17, "the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."

Romanticism was a search for feeling and an exploration of the inner so. Nowhere was this more true than in theology, where the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768 â€“1834) reshaped liberal Protestant thought. Traditionally theologians pondered the infinity and omnipotence of God.  That was less relevant, argued Schleiermacher, than the inner feeling of a person of absolute dependence upon God, and the intuition of God's presence.  Blessedness, he taught, consists in the strengthening of the God-consciousness through the community of believers (the Church); sin is the obscuring of this consciousness.  Jesus Christ shared the humanity of all human beings but was unique in the strength and constancy of his God-consciousness.<ref> Peter Heltzel, "Friedrich Schleiermacher: The Father of Modern Protestant Theology," (1998) [http://people.bu.edu/wwildman/WeirdWildWeb/courses/mwt/dictionary/mwt_themes_470_schleiermacher.htm#Friedrich%20Schleiermacher:%20The%20Father%20of%20Modern%20Protestant%20Theology online]</ref> 

In [[Karl Barth]] in the 20th century reacted against liberal thought and the innerness of God, and insisted on God's transcendance.  Barth stressed the discontinuity between the Christian message and the world.  God is the wholly other;  he is known only in his revelation;  he is not the patron saint of culture, but its judge.<ref> [http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1966/v23-2-article3.htm Robert H. King, "Models Of God's Transcendence," ''Theology Today'' 23#2 (July 1966  p 200+]; see also [http://books.google.com/books?id=0TEkThdhYcIC&pg=PA390&dq=theology+%22with+whom+is+no+variableness%22&lr=&num=30&as_brr=0&ei=HPaRR9bbEpu4sgPYgu1I#PPA395,M1 Charles Hodge, ''Systematic Theology'' (1873) p. 395 online] </ref> 

==Soteriology==
[[Soteriology]] is the theology of salvation. Christians believe that, as a result of the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden, all humans are sinful. Because of this "sinful nature", all people are doomed to be condemned to Hell, for breaking God's command<ref>Theologians cite Romans 3:23 "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (New International Version).</ref>. However, Christian soteriology asserts that Christ came to Earth as a human being, and was killed to take the punishment for man's sin. Christians believe that a person must accept God's forgiveness, and if they do so, that they are allowed to go to heaven.<ref>Theologians cite Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."</ref>. Most Protestants today agree that salvation is "by grace alone", meaning that a person is not required to do good works to get into heaven, although good works will generally be a by-product of salvation.

==Eschatology==
Eschatology is the theology of "last things", or beliefs about the end of the world. Christians believe that after Christ was crucified, he resurrected from the dead (the origin of the celebration of Easter), that he later ascended to heaven, and he will return to Earth. 

The Hebrew and Christian scriptures both have a wide body of work known as prophecy, which purports to predict the future. However, because prophetic literature is highly symbolic, there is very wide disagreement among Christian scholars about how exactly the end of the world will come about. The disagreement tends to focus on when exactly Christ will return to Earth, and whether the book of [[Book of Revelation]] is primarily about past, current, or future events, or whether it should be interpreted as metaphor.

A recurring theme in the history of Christianity is that, in every age, there are Christians who believe that the eschatological pronouncements of the Bible apply to that point in history. Interestingly, this tendency even existed with the earliest Christians. In 1 Corinthians 7, the apostle Paul urges his followers not to worry too much about their present state of affairs: "I mean, brothers and sisters, the appointed time has grown short... For the present form of the world is passing away" (1 Cor. 7:29-31, trans. NRSV)-- a statement most scholars take to mean that Paul believed the return of Christ (and perhaps the end of the world) was immanent.<ref>cf. Paul, by E.P. Sanders, Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 32 ff.</ref>

==Denominational taxonomy==
Christianity has developed into a variety of traditions and ecclesiastical bodies over the past 2,000 years. The broadest division is between [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]], two families that come from historical differences between the the Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]] and Latin-speaking [[Roman Empire]]. The Eastern traditions are made up of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], two associations of national churches in communion (although not with one another). The Western faiths trace their heritage through direct descent, [[Reformation]], or missionizing from the Roman church and include [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], and [[Anglicanism]], as well as spinoff groups such as the Mormons.

In addition, there are hundreds of millions of independent Christians - many in the United States; sub-Saharan Africa, where the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement has been influential; and in China - that have a legacy of some Protestant history, but are not formally associated with a church authority. Some churches from the East have formally joined the Catholic faith, and are historically and culturally Eastern, but ecclesiastically Western.

====Protestantism====
[[Protestantism]] is not a single church body or set of formally-related organizations, but a grouping of various church families whose history extends to the [[Reformation]] in 16th century Europe. The main families are the Lutheran, the Reformed, and the radical sects.

Certain pre-Reformation groups are frequently included in discussions about Protestantism, such as [[Waldensians]] and [[Moravians]], who are legacies of reformation movements lead by [[Peter Waldo]] in 12th-century Italy and [[Jan Hus]] in 15th-century [[Bohemia]]. Some classification systems also include Anglicans as well, as the [[Church of England]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] ceased to be in communion roughly concurrent with the Reformation.

====Anglicanism====
Anglicanism is a form of Christianity with commonalities with both Protestantism and Catholicism. The Anglican Church was formed by [[Henry VIII]] at roughly the same time as the self-definition of Protestantism, and there are some commonalities between Protestantism and Anglicanism. 

At the same time, the emphasis on ritual and liturgy in the Roman Catholic Church is also found, to some extent, in the Anglican Church.

====Independent churches====
Some churches that do not identify with any denomination. Many charismatic or pentecostal churches fall into this category.
