'''Christianity''' is the largest [[religion]] in the world, with over two billion adherents,<ref name="isbn0195079639 ">{{cite book |author=Johnson, Todd M.; Barrett, David B.; Kurian, George Thomas |title=World Christian encyclopedia: a comparative survey of churches and religions in the modern world |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=0195079639 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> and is made up of a large set of traditions originating in first-century [[Palestine]] with the philosophy and teachings of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] (or Yeshua) Christ. As an historical and theological offspring of [[Judaism]], the [[early Christianity|early Christian community]] incorporated the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] into their [[Bible]] and the relationship between the Jewish and Christian traditions remains complex and multifaceted. Christianity is a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] faith that teaches that [[God]] is made up of three persons sharing a single essence (this teaching is known as [[Trinitarianism]]), and that His will for the world has been revealed in the Bible, a book made up of several dozen pieces of literature composed over 2,000 years in the [[Ancient Near East]].

==Theology==
Christian theology centers around several main beliefs. Christianity is monotheistic; that is, Christians believe in one God, who is in 3 persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost). Christians believe that Jesus was both fully human, and fully divine. Christianity asserts that God is ethically perfect, or holy, and that God is immutable; that is, God does not change<ref> Theologians quote James 1:17, "the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."

</ref>.  God was traditionally seen as infinite, as well as omnipotent, or all-powerful, but in the early 19th century Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768 â€“1834)  merged all God's characteristics into the idea of causality and his treatment shaped liberal Protestant thought. Karl Barth in the 20th century emphasized God's transcendance. <ref> [http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/jul1966/v23-2-article3.htm Robert H. King, "Models Of God's Transcendence," ''Theology Today'' 23#2 (July 1966  p 200+]; see also [http://books.google.com/books?id=0TEkThdhYcIC&pg=PA390&dq=theology+%22with+whom+is+no+variableness%22&lr=&num=30&as_brr=0&ei=HPaRR9bbEpu4sgPYgu1I#PPA395,M1 Charles Hodge, ''Systematic Theology'' (1873) p. 395 online] </ref> Lastly, God is omniscient, or all-knowing, although a small minority of Christian scholars argue that God does not exhaustively know the future, a belief known as "open theism".

==Soteriology==
Soteriology is the theology of salvation. Christians believe that, as a result of the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden, all humans are sinful. Because of this "sinful nature", all people are doomed to be condemned to Hell, for breaking God's command. However, Christian soteriology asserts that Christ came to Earth as a human being, and was killed to take the punishment for man's sin. Christians generally believe that a person must accept God's forgiveness, and if they do so, that they are allowed to go to heaven. Most Christian denominations today agree that salvation is "by grace alone", meaning that a person is not required to do good works to get into heaven, although good works will generally be a by-product of salvation.

==Eschatology==
Eschatology is the theology of "last things", or beliefs about the end of the world. Christians believe that after Christ was crucified, he resurrected from the dead (the origin of the celebration of Easter), that he later ascended to heaven, and that some day he will return to Earth. 

The Hebrew and Christian scriptures both have a wide body of work known as prophecy, which purports to predict the future. However, because prophetic literature is highly symbolic, there is very wide disagreement among Christian scholars about how exactly the end of the world will come about. The disagreement tends to focus on when exactly Christ will return to Earth, and whether the book of [[Book of Revelation]] is primarily about past, current, or future events, or whether it should be interpreted as metaphor.

==Denominational taxonomy==
Christianity has developed into a variety of traditions and ecclesiastical bodies over the past 2,000 years. The broadest division is between [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]] and [[Western Christianity]], two families that come from historical differences between the Latin-speaking [[Roman Empire]] and the Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Eastern traditions are made up of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], two associations of national churches in communion (although not with one another) and the much smaller [[Assyrian Church of the East]], whose leadership lives among the [[Assyrian diaspora]] in Chicago. The Western faiths trace their heritage through direct descent, [[Reformation]], or missionizing to the Roman church and include [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], and [[Anglicanism]]. 

In addition, there are hundreds of millions of independent Christians - many in the United States; sub-Saharan Africa, where the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement has been influential; and in China - that have a legacy of some Protestant history, but are not formally associated with a church authority. Some churches from the East have formally joined the Catholic faith, and are historically and culturally Eastern, but ecclesiastically Western. Additionally, there are some movements - such as [[Messianic Judaism]] or [[Christian anarchism]] - which eschew these distinctions, and are based on a  radical interpretation of [[early Christianity]].

====Protestantism====
[[Protestantism]] is not a single church body or set of formally-related organizations, but a grouping of various church families whose history extends to the [[Reformation]] in 16th century [[Europe]]. Certain pre-Reformation groups are frequently included in discussions about Protestantism, such as [[Waldensians]] and [[Moravians]], who are legacies of reformation movements lead by [[Peter Waldo]] in 12th-century [[Italy]] and [[Jan Hus]] in 15th-century [[Bohemia]]. Some classification systems also include Anglicans as well, as the [[Church of England]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] ceased to be in communion roughly concurrent with the Reformation.
