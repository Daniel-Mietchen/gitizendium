'''Robert Nozick''' (November 16, 1938 â€“ January 23, 2002) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[polital philosophy|political philosopher]] at [[Harvard University]], and most famous as author of ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' (1974), a libertarian critique of [[John Rawls]]' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Nozick also pioneered a thought experiment called the ''experience machine'', which attempted to show that people prefer real experiences compared to simulations (refuting ethical [[hedonism]]), and the ''utility monster'' thought experiment to show that [[utilitarianism]] is not egalitarian.
