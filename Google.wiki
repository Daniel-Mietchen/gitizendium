==Criticism==
Google's unofficial motto is "Don't be evil"<ref>''San Francisco Chronicle'', "[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/01/26/EDGNSGSK5U1.DTL Don't be Google]", Debra J. Saunders, January 26, 2006.</ref>, which is contradicted by the facts listed below.

*Google has agreed to [[censorship|censor]] results for queries made from China. Google has decided to do so to stop [[China]] from hindering Chinese user searches (blocking Google or substantially slowing down the result display). Google has agreed to block content that the Chinese government deems unacceptable, which displeased [[Reporters Without Borders]]<ref>''Fox News.com'', "[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,182695,00.html China's Google Search Engine to Be Censored]", [Associated Press], January 25, 2006.</ref>. This story happened after Google refused to help the U.S. [[Department of Justice]] with its efforts to fight against [[child pornography]] and started to be seen as a [[privacy]] proponent for this reason<ref>''San Francisco Chronicle'', "[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/01/26/EDGNSGSK5U1.DTL Don't be Google]", Debra J. Saunders, January 26, 2006.</ref>. [[Sergey Brin]] admitted that by censoring results he compromised Google's mantra (Don't be evil)<ref>''Cnet Asia'', "[http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/lemaklemang/post.htm?id=39367104 Google... 'Don't be evil']", Jeff Ooi, June 12, 2006.</ref>.
*[[Google Reader]] now automatically allows any contacts you have at in your [[Gmail]] account see to what feeds you are subscribed. Now, if somebody write to somebody else once, both can see all the other's feeds from their Google Reader account<ref>''Profy'', "[http://www.profy.com/2007/12/27/google-reader-privacy-mess/ Don't Be... What Was That Again? We Seem to Have Forgotten]", Cyndy Aleo-Carreira, December 27th, 2007.</ref>.
*Google [[cookie]]s are criticized by the [[World Privacy Forum]] and others. They to expire automatically after two years, but Google has become so prevalent that this basically mean that the cookies will not be erased unless you don't visit any Google sites for two years. Those cookies contain unique IDs that make it possible to create a dossier about a specific user (for advertisement, for instance). It is possible to delete the cookies by oneself (and even block them entirely), but many users are not even aware of the existence of cookies<ref>''USA Today'', "[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-07-19-google-cookies-privacy_N.htm Google's cookie policy good for privacy?]", Anick Jesdanun, July 19, 2007.</ref>.
