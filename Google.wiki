==Controversies==
The Google Book Search Library Project, in which millions of books from libraries will be scanned and made searchable on the Web, has led to controversy and legal action. In support of Google's mission to "organize the world's information," the Google Book Search program is designed to digitize printed book content so that it may be searched and retrieved via Google's search engine.  The program has two facetsâ€”one that involves publishers, which has not been controversial, and one that involves libraries, which has. The University of Michigan has committed to allowing Google to scan its entire print and journal collection.  Publishers are suing Google for copyright infringement, while Google claims their use falls under the fair use privilege of the Copyright Act. <ref> Baksik (2006) </ref> 


Google has agreed to censor results for queries made from China. Google has decided to do so to stop [[China]] from hindering Chinese user searches (blocking Google or substantially slowing down the result display). Google has agreed to block content that the Chinese government deems unacceptable. <ref>''Fox News.com'', "[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,182695,00.html China's Google Search Engine to Be Censored]", [Associated Press], January 25, 2006.</ref>.

Google [[cookie]]s are criticized by the [[World Privacy Forum]] and others. They expire automatically after two years, but cookies will not be erased unless a person does not visit any Google sites for two years. <ref>''USA Today'', "[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2007-07-19-google-cookies-privacy_N.htm Google's cookie policy good for privacy?]", Anick Jesdanun, July 19, 2007.</ref>.
