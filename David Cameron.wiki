===Early parliamentary and party career===

==Leader of the Conservative Party, 2005-==
In 2005, [[Michael Howard]], the Home Secretary under [[John Major]], ran against Tony Blair's Labour Party on the Conservative ticket but lost. Following this defeat, he resigned as leader of the Conservative Party and made way for a lengthy leadership contest. <ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4521941.stm Howard to stand down as leader], 6 May, 2005</ref> Cameron was involved in formulating the 2005 Conservative manifesto.

Cameron was elected as the leader of the Conservative Party against [[David Davis]], a more traditional Conservative candidate but with a strong civil libertarian streak, as well as [[Ken Clarke]] and [[Liam Fox]]. Cameron rejected a number of standard Conservative policies: he stated that he was for the then recently introduced same-sex civil partnerships and started talking up his support for green policies on [[climate change]], [[recycling]] and the environment. The slogan "vote blue, go green" was used by the party to highlight this new position on climate change. Similarly, Cameron has tried to get the support of the gay community - not supportive of Conservatives especially since the passing of [[Section 28]] during the Thatcher years - meeting with [[Peter Tatchell]], giving interviews to gay magazines, pledging support for anti-homophobia campaigns and selecting a number of openly gay candidates.<ref>SameSame, [http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/5375/New-Brit-PM-believes-in-gay-equality.htm New Brit.
