'''Postmodernism''' is not so much a theory or school but a mood, reacting to the [[objectivity]] of what postmodernists feel to be a [[modernism|modernist]] culture - defined by [[science]], [[authority]] and [[metanarratives]]. The word postmodernism borders on tautology - modern is usually understood to mean current, but how can postmodernism be post-now? Postmodernism also has another problem: that in its advocacy of rejecting metanarratives, it is itself creating a metanarrative.

Postmodernism has become popular since the 1980s, where it came out of various strands of [[critical theory]], including [[poststructuralism]], [[deconstruction]] and a new focus on issues of gender, race and identity (see [[queer theory]], [[postcolonialism]]).
