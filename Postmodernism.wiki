'''Postmodernism''' is a broad collection of critical theories, political attitudes and literary and artistic practices that react to what postmodernists feel to be a [[modernism|modernist]] culture - one defined by belief in [[science|scientific knowledge]], moral [[authority]], [[historical progress]] and a [[foundationalist]] view of language and the self. Such ideas, alongside other similar "Western values" are the focus of the postmodernist critique which identifies them as totalizing [[metanarratives]]. Metanarratives, according to the postmodernist, are conceptual place-holders for linguistic [[indeterminacy]], conceptual [[genealogy|genealogies]] and, more often then not, oppressive [[hegemony|hegemonies]]. In place of these metanarratives, postmodernists advocate the adoption [[nonfoundationalist]] [[espistemology]], [[moral relativism]] and [[pluralism|plularist]] politics. The wider cultural implications of these ideas are reflected in postmodernism's literary and artistic values, which emphasize [[irony]], [[pastiche]], [[self-reflexivity]], repetition and replication alongside a disregard for the traditional divide between "high" and "low" culture. These remarks, however, can only be taken as a general account of postmodernism, seeing as many as those who subscribe to to it "resist closed, tightly bounded "totalizing" accounts of such things as the "essence" of the postmodern"<ref>Kevin J. Vanhoozer, "Theology and the condition of postmodernity: a report on knowledge (of God)" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Postmodern Theology'' (ed. Kevin J. Vanhoozer), ch. 1, p. 3.</ref>.

Postmodernism emerged from various strands of [[critical theory]], including [[poststructuralism]] and [[deconstruction]], and brought with it a new focus on issues of gender, race and identity (see [[queer theory]], [[postcolonialism]]). [[Jean-François Lyotard|Jean-François Lyotard's]] 1979 book ''The Postmodern Condition'' popularised the concept which has enjoyed academic relevance and popular currency since the early 1980s. Postmodernism has also been influential in many different disciplines - starting with [[postmodern architecture|architecture]], but spreading through literature, [[postmodern philosophy|philosophy]], cultural studies, history, the arts (including visual arts, cinema and performance arts), [[postmodern theology|theology and religious studies]] and even computing<ref>Larry Wall, [http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html Perl, the first postmodern computer language]</ref>. The diversity of these different approaches can suggest that postmodernism is representative of a cultural 'break', separating Western culture today from what went before.

=== Criticism ===

The word postmodernism borders on tautology - modern is usually understood to mean current, but how can postmodernism be post-now? Postmodernism also has another problem: that in its advocacy of rejecting metanarratives, it is itself creating a metanarrative.
