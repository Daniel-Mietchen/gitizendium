'''The Adventures of Tintin''' is a series of comic strips and books created by [[Herg√©]] - the pen name of Georges Remi. They tell the story of Tintin, a young Belgian reporter, accompanied by a fox terrier called Snowy. The adventures took place across the globe, including [[Tibet]], [[Egypt]], the [[Congo]], [[China]], a fictional country in the Middle East called Khemed, Soviet [[Russia]], the [[United States]] (specifically, gangster-era [[Chicago]]), and even the [[Moon]].

The books have been extremely controversial, with accusations of [[sexism]], [[imperialism]], [[anti-Semitism]] and positive depiction of animal cruelty.
