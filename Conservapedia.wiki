'''Conservapedia''' is an [[internet]] [[encyclopedia]] project that attempts to present information from a [[conservatism|conservative]] and pro-[[United States of America|American]] viewpoint. 
It is a [[wiki]] project using the same [[Mediawiki]] [[software]] as [[Citizendium]] and [[Wikipedia]]; the site has set itself up in opposition particularly to Wikipedia and its perceived "[[liberalism|liberal]] bias".<ref>''Conservapedia'': '[http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Examples_of_Bias_in_Wikipedia&oldid=249783 Examples of bias in Wikipedia].' July 25th 2007.</ref> It was founded in November, 2006, by [[Andrew Schlafly]], son of conservative commentator [[Phyllis Schlafly]], and originally began as a class project by [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] students.<ref>''Conservapedia'': '[http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:About Conservapedia:About].'</ref> As of October, 2008, it had about 26,000 articles.<ref>''Conservapedia'': '[http://www.conservapedia.com/Special:Statistics Special:Statistics].'</ref>

==Editorial policy==
Like Wikipedia, all contributors can freely edit articles unless the page has been protected, and [[anonymity]] is permitted. In line with its [[religion|religious]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] theme, Conservapedia's editorial policy consists of "Commandments", a reference to the [[Ten Commandments|two sets of laws]] the [[Bible]] says were handed down to [[Moses]] from [[God]]. The Commandments require, among others, that "everything... be [[truth|true]] and verifiable" and also enforce a [[family]]-friendly policy.<ref>''Conservapedia'': '[http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Conservapedia:Commandments&oldid=207247 Conservapedia:Commandments].' June 23rd 2007.</ref> Until March, 2007, Conservapedia required by Commandment that "As much as possible, American [[spelling]] of [[word]]s must be used",<ref>''Conservapedia'': '[http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Conservapedia:Commandments&oldid=55263 Conservapedia:Commandments].' March 21st 2007.</ref> but now the site's "Manual of Style" presents American spellings as being preferred, with [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] spellings possible depending on the [[context]].<ref>''Conservapedia'': '[http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Conservapedia:Manual_of_Style&oldid=252988#Spelling Conservapedia:Manual of Style - Spelling].' July 27th 2007.</ref>

Conservapedia also emphasises that it does not "attempt to be [[neutrality|neutral]] to all points of view". This seems to potentially allow for descriptions which ''favor'' one side rather than none; its own example of how "[[terrorism|terrorist]]" is preferable to "militant", in contrast to what Wikipedia might use, presupposes that the subject ''is'' a terrorist.<ref>''Conservapedia'': '[http://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Conservapedia:How_Conservapedia_Differs_from_Wikipedia&oldid=239880 How Conservapedia Differs from Wikipedia].' July 18th 2007.</ref>  

Conservapedia administrators frequently have to block [[vandalism (wiki)|vandals]] attempting to insert inappropriate material.<ref>''Conservapedia'': '[http://www.conservapedia.com/Special:Ipblocklist IP block list]. 

According to this list, in June 2007, administrators blocked 1,598 accounts and [[IP address]]es; in the same period, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Ipblocklist English-language Wikipedia blocked 8,574], despite the latter having about 100 times more articles. Citizendium [http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Special:Ipblocklist blocked four], with about 2,400 articles.</ref>

Liberal commentators have made fun of the obsession of Conservapedia readers with [[homosexuality]]<ref>The Young Turks, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCV158ln_zk How Ridiculous are Conservatives?]</ref>, as well as the entries on [[creation science]].
In its first year, [[Young Earth creationism]] held sway, but now [[Old Earth creationism]] is an equal partner.
