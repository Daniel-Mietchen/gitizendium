'''Racism''' is the belief in the difference, and often superiority, of one [[race|racial]] group over another and discriminatory or hateful statements and actions based on said beliefs. This belief in racial superiority is often based on perceived difference in characteristics&mdash;physical or mental. A variety of reasons have been put forward attempting to justify racism, including religious beliefs about particular tribes (the Mormon belief that God made those who rebelled against him have redskins is one example, and there are those that emphasize religious ideas within racist movements), beliefs stemming from scientific change such as [[eugenics]] and [[Social Darwinism]], and often the use of racism as part of political ideologies to define ''the Other''.

== Racism today ==
Racism is now widely condemned in Western society, especially since the [[Holocaust]]&mdash;with explicit racist groups like [[white nationalism|white nationalists]] often operating as secret subcultures. This does not mean racism has gone away&mdash;many people still think racism has morphed into a more enigmatic form with more use of codewords (the celebration of 'Christian', 'European' or 'Germanic' culture), and through [[institutional racism]], where the structure of institutions like the government, [[University|universities]] and business, where an institution ''unconsciously'' acts in a racist way. An example of this is the criticism levelled at the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] in [[London]] following the race-motivated stabbing of the black teenager [[Stephen Lawrence]]. Racism in the Metropolitan Police, the British military and other services has led to significant reform, and in these uniformed services, racism is now harshly punished, often with dismissal. A 2003 [[BBC]] documentary, ''The Secret Policeman'', uncovered numerous examples of racism that occurs within police training, and even found officers who have engaged in racist discrimination on the job.

In the [[2008 United States Presidential election]], the issue of racism was significant because of the nomination and subsequent election of [[Barack Obama]], the first non-white American President. During the campaign, a number of pundits and pollsters warned that despite Obama's excellent polling results compared to Republican candidate [[John McCain]], he could suffer from the [[Bradley effect]] in the final election - that is, white voters telling pollsters that they would vote for the black candidate but not following through when they vote. Obama's success has led some to suggest that the Bradley effect may be diminishing, and that America is becoming "post-racial". Professor [[Cornel West]] of [[Princeton University]] stated that America is not becoming post-racial, but Obama's election shows it is becoming less racist<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/11/19/cornel_west_on_the_election_of Democracy Now 2008-11-19 Transcript]</ref>.
