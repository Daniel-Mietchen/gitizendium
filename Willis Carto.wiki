In the early 1950s, he served as director of the Congress of Freedom, "which sought to build coalitions between racists and hard-right libertarians, and as executive secretary of Liberty and Property (which he founded).", and was editor of '' Right'', "an information clearinghouse for racist and anti-Semitic activities". <ref name=ADL>{{citation
