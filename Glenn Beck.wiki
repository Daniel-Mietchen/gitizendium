'''Glenn Beck''' (1964-) is a U.S. [[political opinion broadcasting|political opinion broadcaster]] and author, with a show on [[Fox News]], and his own website, books and national tours. Among the top three talk hosts in listener size, he is strongly identified with [[American conservatism]], and has started a movement called the [[9-12 Project]], strongly critical of liberal ideas and suspicious of large government.  

Among Fox opinion commentators, Beck differentiates himself as a highly emotional "revivalist in a troubled land", with an apocalyptic vision, as opposed to [[Bill O'Reilly]] as an "outsider" and [[Sean Hannity]] as an ideologue. Conservative writer [[David Frum]] called  Beck's success the “...product of the collapse of conservatism as an organized political force, and the rise of conservatism as an alienated cultural sensibility. It’s a show for people who feel they belong to an embattled minority that is disenfranchised and cut off." Beck calls himself an entertainer that challenges his critics: "I’m a rodeo clown...It takes great skill.”<ref name=NYT2009-03-30>{{citation

[[Tom Rosenstiel]], of the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]], speaks of his appeal in historical terms: “There was a lot of radio evangelism during the Depression. People were frustrated and frightened. There are a lot of scary parallels now.” 
==Early life==
There is little question that he started broadcasting at the age of 13. <ref name=About>{{citation
 | title = About the Glenn Beck Program
 | url = http://www.glennbeck.com/content/program/about/
 | publisher = Glenn Beck Program}}</ref>  There are, however, various versions of his early life. He grew up in Mount Vernon, [[Washington]], a farm town that, in the 1960s, had a considerable counterculture component, although his father, William Beck, was known as a conventional bakery owner. Quoted by Salon.com, Beck said it was ethnically homogeneous: "the source of his lingering discomfort around Jews and other ethnic minorities. 'I'm the whitest guy you will ever meet," Beck never tires of saying. "The first time I saw an African-American, my dad had to tell me to stop staring.'" The family was active in the local Catholic church, and he and his sisters attended religious schools.  <ref name=Salon2009-09-21>{{citation | date = 21 September 2009

===Mother's death===
===Redemption===
The theme of redemption recurs in his own, and other accounts, of his career. According to his website, at age 30, he "was consumed by alcoholism and drug addiction. Coming to terms with his past and staying sober shifted his life direction." <ref name=About />His second wife, Tania, required him to convert to Mormonism before they were wed.  

He suffers from [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], and credits religion and [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] for his stability. <ref name=NNDB>{{citation

==On-air comments==
Beck's on-air commentary uses dramatic imagery, which different observers call everything from showmanship to demagoguery to loss of emotional control.
===Violent imagery===
In a skit with a woman wearing a mask of [[U.S. Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]],  on 6 August 2009, he spoke of poisoning her. <blockquote> So, Speaker Pelosi, I just wanted to — you gonna drink your wine? Are you blind? Do those eyes not work? There you — I want you to drink it now. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it.

I really just wanted to thank you for having me over here to wine country. You know, to be invited, I thought I had to be a major Democratic donor or a longtime friend of yours, which I’m not.

By the way, I put poison in your — no, I — I look forward to all the policy discussions that we’re supposed to have — you know, on health care, energy reform, and the economy.<ref name=MM>{{citation

On a [[CNN]] interview of Rep. [[Keith Ellison]] ([[U.S. Democratic Party|D-]][[Minnesota]]), the first Muslim elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], he questioned Ellison's loyalty to the United States. Beck said, with respect to Iraq, "You are saying, "Let`s cut and run." And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview with you, because what I feel like saying is, "Sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies." And I know you`re not. I`m not accusing you of being an enemy, but that`s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way."<ref>{{citation

He mused about killing left-wing filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] on his show of 17 May 2005.<blockquote>I'm thinking about killing Michael Moore, and I'm wondering if I could kill him myself, or if I would need to hire somebody to do it. No, I think I could. I think he could be looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking the life out -- is this wrong? I stopped wearing my What Would Jesus -- band -- Do, and I've lost all sense of right and wrong now. I used to be able to say, "Yeah, I'd kill Michael Moore," and then I'd see the little band: What Would Jesus Do? And then I'd realize, "Oh, you wouldn't kill Michael Moore. Or at least you wouldn't choke him to death." And you know, well, I'm not sure.<ref name=MM2005-05-18>{{citation

===Social justice===
In March 2010, he said, <blockquote>I'm begging you, your right to religion and freedom to exercise religion and read all of the passages of the Bible as you want to read them and as your church wants to preach them . . . are going to come under the ropes in the next year. If it lasts that long it will be the next year. I beg you, look for the words 'social justice' or 'economic justice' on your church Web site. If you find it, run as fast as you can. Social justice and economic justice, they are code words. Now, am I advising people to leave their church? Yes!"</blockquote>

Later, Beck held up cards, one with a hammer and sickle and other with a swastika. 
<blockquote>Communists are on the left, and the Nazis are on the right. That's what people say. But they both subscribe to one philosophy, and they flew one banner. . . . But on each banner, read the words, here in America: 'social justice.' They talked about economic justice, rights of the workers, redistribution of wealth, and surprisingly, democracy."<ref>{{citation

===Eric Massa===
===Bruce Springsteen===
On his 11 March 2010 show, Beck said <blockquote>You get filled with patriotic pride, and then you find out that [[Bruce Springsteen]]’s "Born In The U.S.A." is anti-American. ‘Born down in a dead man’s town/ the first kick I took is when I hit the ground/ you end up like a dog that’s been beat too much/ so you spend half your life just covering up…’ (He reads the entire lyrics in an incredulous tone of voice; manages to mispronounce '[[Battle of Khe Sanh|Khe Sanh]]')Hmm. Yeah! [crosstalk] … It’s time for us to wake up out of our dream state. Out of the propaganda… This is the thing that people who come from the Soviet bloc or Cuba, they’re all saying, ‘How do you guys not hear this? How are you not seeing this?’ Well, because we don’t ever expect it.”<ref>{{citation

==9-12 Project==
{{main|9-12 Project}}
On March 13, 2009, Beck announced the creation of the [[9-12 Project]] as a movement whose name invokes U.S. response to the [[9-11 Attacks]]:
<blockquote>On 9/10 we were burying our heads in the sand or we were playing politics. It was about Republicans or Democrats. On 9/11 we were freaking out and no one knew who attacked us, where did this come from, what is this. On 9/12 no one in the government had to tell us what to do. We just did it.<ref name=Announce>{{citation

According to his open letter of November 2009, Beck said, <ref name=Letter>{{citation

On his show, he said "Coming this January, my whole approach changes on this program. This next year is going to be critical, and I think it's going to change and I think we are going to set it right, at least set our course right. And if that means the Democrats or the Republicans are destroyed along the way, well, good. Good. " <ref name=Politico2009-11-21>{{citation

The project has no explicit funding, but its website content is produced by Beck's production company, [[Mercury Radio Arts]], and hosted on [[Fox News]]' servers. There is considerable synergy between this and the [[Tea Party Movement]]. <ref name=AP2009-09-12>{{citation

Beck's direct participation in political activities may put the project under the jurisdiction of campaign finance law. <ref name=Politico2009-11-21 />  Further complicating the political finance situation are campaigns for office by people associated with the project., such as [[Dan Eichenbaum]] in [[North Carolina]]'s 11th Congressional District<ref name=PRNW2009-12-09>, {{citation

Glenn Beck can defend "the white culture" and call Obama a "racist" in poverty and in private." Clarke said he can accept, however, the Fox statement that "'While the advertising boycott has generated substantial media coverage', Fox News said it has not impacted the network's revenues or Beck's audience. 'The advertisers referenced have all moved their spots from Beck to other programs on the network so there has been no revenue lost.'"<ref name=Atlantic2009-08-25>{{citation

Supporters argue that this is left-wing bias by a "left-wing African American advocacy group named colorofchange.org. The group, founded by self-described communist Van Jones, now the Obama Administration’s ‘green jobs’ czar, claims to promote inclusion of minorities in the process of developing an environmentally-sound economy." A website, DefendGlenn.com, is encouraging a counter-boycott of firms that have dropped their advertising. <ref name=ORE>{{citation

==Conflict of interest allegations==
His current advertisers do include gold sellers Goldline International, which offers investing in precious metals as a hedge against catastrophic economic events. While his personal financial interest in Goldline is described as obvious on his radio show, it has been questioned if he keeps proper separation when speaking of apocalyptic events on television, events against which gold buying is considered a hedge. <ref name=Boston2009-12-13>{{citation
