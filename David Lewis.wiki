'''David Kellogg Lewis''' (September 28, 1941 â€“ October 14, 2001) was an American [[philosophy|philosopher]] who is best known for his [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] work in which he advocated a controversial [[modal realism]] - that is, he stated that the possible worlds that philosophers suppose in order to explain the nature of necessity and possibility exist in a concrete form. Lewis taught for most of his life at [[Princeton University]], but also had a short stint teaching at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]].

Lewis published five books: ''Convention: A Philosophical Study'' (1969), ''Counterfactuals'' (1973), ''Semantic Analysis: Essays Dedicated to [[Stig Kanger]] on His Fiftieth Birthday'' (1974) and ''On the Plurality of Worlds'' (1986) - which expounds Lewis' modal realism - and ''Parts of Classes'' (1991). He also published five essay collections - ''Philosophical Papers'' Volumes 1 and 2 (1983 and 1986 respectively), ''Papers in Philosophical Logic'' (1988), ''Papers in Metaphysics and Epistemology'' (1999) and ''Papers in Ethics and Social Philosophy''.
