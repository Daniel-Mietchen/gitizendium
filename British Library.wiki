The '''British Library''' is the national reference library and archive of the [[United Kingdom]] and houses 150 million items on 625 km of shelving - predominantly books, and has significant collections of newspapers and periodicals, maps, sound recordings, historically significant manuscripts and public records (including patents). The Library is currently housed close to [[St Pancras]] station, on Euston Road in [[London]] and has a newspaper library at [[Collingdale]].

Readers are allowed access based on claimed need, and are able to access a number of Reading Rooms, which provide both access to materials both on the shelf and through over-the-counter requests. The Reading Rooms have around 400,000 visitors every year and have a capacity to hold 1,200 readers. Materials are stored in London and in the Document Supply Centre at Boston Spa in Yorkshire - the latter taking 48 hours to request. The Library also recieves every book published in the UK, as required by the [[Copyright Act]].

There has recently been some controversy regarding the change in admissions policy for Reader passes, which before would require a referee from a university, library or publishing company to gain access. This has now been changed so that almost anybody can get a Reader pass, which many say has led to increase of use of the library by school and undergraduate university students who would be better served at a local, school or university library - and that younger library users cause considerable distraction to people with a more pressing need to use the library<ref>Sarah Lyell, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/04/28/europe/journal.php Relaxed admission brings chaos to the British Library], ''International Herald Tribune'', 28 April, 2008</ref>.
