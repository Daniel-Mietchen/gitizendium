'''Bill Clinton''' (formally '''William Jefferson Clinton'''; born William Jefferson Blythe III) was a Democratic president of the United States, elected in 1992 and 1996. Previously he served as governor of Arkansas. His administration was characterized by sustained prosperity, free trade internationally, the end of the [[New Deal]] welfare system, and an impeachment attempt that succeeded in the House but failed in the Senate. Known as a brilliant campaigner and policy wonk, as well as a womanizer, he became a very well paid speaker after leaving the White House. His wife, '''[[Hillary Clinton]]''' was elected to the Senate in 2000 from New York, reelected in 2006, and in 2007 was the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. Clinton has become a major fundraiser for his wife and has proven to be an effective campaigner with Blacks against her leading challenger, Senator [[Barak Obama]].

==Early Career==
==Election of 1992==
The Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) formed in early 1985 to formulate a moderate Democratic agenda. With [[Al From]] as executive director and Georgia Senator [[Sam Nunn]] as chairman, DLC comprised mostly Southern Democratic congressmen. They sought to rebuild the party's image after a series of defeats by Reagan and Bush. They wanted to assure voters that the moderate-conservative wing of the party was alive and well, and that its policy initiatives fit with mainstream American values. After the 1988 defeat, From asked Clinton in March 1990 to become the first DLC Chair from outside Washington. He and Clinton recruited state and local officials from around the country for the DLC, trying out some of the policy initiatives developed by the affiliated think tank the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI).  Proposals that found their way into Clinton's 1992 platform included:
* Apprenticeship programs for non-college-bound skilled workers 
* A program of national service for college students (with student loan forgiveness)
* A ROTC-style program to train new police officers in colleges
* An enhanced Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor 
* Government-subsidized individual savings accounts for Social Security.

The two DLC manifestos and Clinton's 1991 "New Covenant" speech accounted for more than 60% of the promises in the 1992 Democratic platform. <ref> Borrelli, 432-35</ref>  Clinton campaigned as a "New Democrat," with an appeal to southerners and moderates that included demands for welfare reform and support for the death penalty.

==Domestic Policies==
Clinton's honeymoon with Congress was abriptly cancelled when the issue of gay rights in the military exploded in his first days in office.  During the campaign Clinton had quietly promised gays that he would end harrassment in the military. The public debate injured Clinton and he was forced to accept the military's compromise, the "Don't ask, don't tell," which remains in effect in 2007, and penalizes people who are openly gay. 

One of Clinton's favorite programs was "AmeriCorps," modeled after the Peace Corps and the [[CCC]]. It sent 100,000 youth into paid public service jobs around the country. It was an expansion of a Bush program. 
===Health Care policies===
On 22 September 1993, Clinton called for a national medical care system that would incorporate the 15% of the population that was entitled to emergency care but lacked broader insurance. Polls showed strong initial support, but the 1994 elections shattered hopes for the passage of such a plan. Clinton decided on a plan using regional insurance purchasing agencies along with modest tax subsidies to combine universal coverage with cost efficiency. He and his advisors believed the plan would be acceptable to big business and the larger insurance companies, but the plan was opposed by a well-financed campaign. Skocpol (1996) suggests the major mistake may have been in emphasizing the cost-reducing aspect of the plan, not realizing that Americans were willing to pay for a government program that would provide generous benefits to them. The fear that Clinton's proposals would lead to the sort of health care rationing prevalent in Canada and other countries further troubled the voters. Starr (1997) notes that Clinton sought to achieve liberal ends of universal coverage through the conservative means of managed competition among private health plans, with a backup cap on the rate of growth in average insurance premiums. This approach had a political as well as policy rationale. It was meant to be the basis of an alliance that could include conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans and thereby achieve the majorities necessary for congressional passage. But what we saw as compromise, they did not -- especially as the very locus of the political center shifted to the right during the debate. Health care reform that seemed "inevitable" to many serious observers at the start became unthinkable by the end.

==National Security Policy==
Butfoy (2006) argues that in the 1990s the "revolution in military affairs" (RMA), which produced "smart" weapons like cruise missiles, came of age. This apparently transformed how America viewed the relationship between force and international relations. It looked as though technology was framing foreign policy. In particular, smart weapons enabled Clinton to combine risk minimization with an expanded security agenda. However, we should be wary of ascribing technological determinism to the conflicts of the 1990's dominated by Washington's flexing of its strategic superiority, such as its bombing of Belgrade. As shown by comparison with US strategy after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, Washington's stance in the 1990's was shaped by linkages between technology and specific political circumstances. As these circumstances changed, so did the RMA's place in US efforts to shape world order.
==1996 Election==
===Impeachment===
==Clinton voter Coalition==
===Public Opinion: Clinton's popularity===
Needham (2005) argues the "permanent campaign" is said to have reached its apogee in the incumbent communications strategies of Clinton and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. However, their assiduous courting of public opinion while in office has been used to explain both the high approval ratings of these leaders and their unpopularity for long periods of their incumbency. This apparent paradox suggests that the permanent campaign model is too blunt an instrument to usefully describe or evaluate incumbent communications. Its assumption of continuity between election campaigning and office-holding fails to explain how the strategic terrain changes once a challenger takes office. The concepts of branding and relationship marketing can be used to highlight the difference between gaining support in the one-off transaction of an election and retaining voter loyalty in a post-"purchase" setting. The success of Blair and Clinton in establishing a relationship with voters from within office can be assessed using six attributes of successful brands: simplicity, uniqueness, reassurance, aspiration, values, and credibility. As incumbents, facing challenges in shifting strategic and institutional environments, Blair and Clinton developed messages that were simple and appealed to voter aspirations. Voters remained skeptical about the extent to which these leaders embodied values and delivered on their promises.
