'''White nationalism''' is a political movement defined by a belief in [[race|racial]] difference, aiming for a politically separate nation that exists solely for people of a white, European ethnic origin. White nationalists claim to not believe in racial superiority, but rather ''separatism'' - in the [[United States]], for instance, white nationalism can often take the form of white [[Secession|secessionism]] or [[Confederatism]]. Supporters of white nationalism often state that they are defending what they see as ''white culture'', fighting for the civil liberties of white people and against a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], liberal elite in [[politics]], [[business]] and the [[media]].
