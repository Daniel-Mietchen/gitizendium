A <b>religion</b> can be defined as a system of [[belief]]s, values, principles, [[philosophy]], [[mythos]], and [[ritual]]s that deal with the ultimate concern of a person or society.  Common (but not universal) elements of religion include organized [[worship]] (possibly including a place of worship, commonly called a [[temple]], [[church]], or [[shrine]]), beliefs regarding the [[supernatural]], and respect for a high figure (who may or may not be [[divine]]).

The meaning and scope of the word "religion" (and its other-language equivalents) are the subjects of much disagreeement. A few borderline examples will serve as illustrations. Textbooks on religion often include Confucianism, but its adherents often disagree, pointing to Confucius' reluctance to discuss the supernatural. Freemasonry claims not to be a religion (since members of any religion may join); however others consider its tradition of texts, rituals, ethics, and group solidarity to qualify it as religious. And for all its anti-religious rhetoric, Soviet Communism boasted "sacred" texts, condemned "heretics", revered founders, conducted rituals, and promoted an elaborate eschatological prophecy in the form of the future workers' utopia. 

Finally, many traditional societies make no clear distinction between "religious" and "nonreligious" aspects of daily life. How are we to decide, for example, whether a particular people's understanding of their place in the cosmos qualifies as a belief to which they adhere (in this connection we might consider scientific worldviews prevailing in industrialized societies); or whether a custom or practice is best described under the heading of religious rules, or etiquette? 

That said, elements which are often associated with "religion" include: 

:*a distinctive worldview or belief-system
:*group identity
:*social institutions
:*rituals
:*rules or behavioral expectations
:*a focus on the supernatural


== Organizing Religions ==

Organizing religions is a difficult task, as theologians differ on where the differences lie.  For example, while "[[Christianity]]" describes a set of common beliefs in [[God]], [[Jesus]], and the [[afterlife]], there are vast differences in the various churches of Christianity.

As an example, the [[Baptist]] faith, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Mormonism]], and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] all base their faith on the [[Bible]], but take different views on such things as organization, the necessity of proselytization, the rituals that have to be observed to be a devout Christian, the will of God, and the nature of [[evil]].

However, there are some common divisions that many scholars agree to:

"[[Abrahamic]]", [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religions believe in ONE creator god, prophetes, and an afterlife.  Although [[Judaism]] is traditionally believed to be the oldest of the three main brances, Rabbinical Judaism developped parallel to Christianity. Both stem from the earlier [[Israelite religion]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] -- Christianity owing a lot to Greek and (later) Roman thinking. Christianity only got a clear form through the [[ecumenical council]]s in the fourth century, Judaism by the redaction of the Babylonian [[talmud]]. Abrahamic religions include [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] (which is separated into hundreds of brances), [[Orthodox Christianity]], [[Oriental Christianity]], [[Mormonism]], and [[Islam]] (which has several major branches).

[[Buddhism]] is ultimately derived from the life and teachings of [[Siddhartha Gautama]] (c. [[600 BCE]]), although his teachings did not displace, but instead absorbed, the philosophies of the regions it spread to, providing for a continuence with other earlier faiths.  The three main branches of Buddhism are traditionally regarded as [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]], although some scholars speak of a "fourth Buddhism" coming into existance as the religion is studied in areas politically, geographically, and linguistically distinct from Buddhism's [[India]]n origins.  It also played an important role in [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]]; however, these generally absorbed Buddhists philosophies, not the supernatural or ritual elements of Buddhism.

[[Hinduism]] is a group of distinct but intimately related religions, made possible through the practice of [[henotheism]].  It is sometimes said that there as many forms of Hinduism as there are Hindus; however, the most-worshipped [[trinity]] of gods includes [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]].  It had a strong influence on other Indian religions, including [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].

[[Neopaganism]] (or "[[New Age]]") is a term that was coined to describe the modern trend of new religions which have a strong belief in the [[supernatural]].  Some religions strongly reject the label as it has been used derisively by scholars of other faiths, while some religions accept the label proudly.  These religions are very diverse, from [[doctrine|doctrinal]] to philosophical; some seem to have been created-whole cloth, while others are explicitly based on another religion.  Some of the best known Neopagan religions include [[Asatru]], [[Raelism]], [[Scientology]], [[Tenrikyo]], and [[Wicca]].  [[Unitarian Universalism]] is sometimes considered a Neopagan religion, and sometimes a Judeochristian religion; it merits individual study.
