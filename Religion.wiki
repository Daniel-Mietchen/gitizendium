A <b>religion</b> can be defined as a system of [[belief]]s, values, principles, [[philosophy]], [[mythos]], and [[ritual]]s that deal with the ultimate concern of a person or society.  Common (but not universal) elements of religion include organized [[worship]] (possibly including a place of worship, commonly called a [[temple]], [[church]], or [[shrine]]), beliefs regarding the [[supernatural]], and respect for a high figure (who may or may not be [[divine]]).

== Organizing Religions ==

Organizing religions is a difficult task, as theologians differ on where the differences lie.  For example, while "[[Christianity]]" describes a set of common beliefs in [[God]], [[Jesus]], and the [[afterlife]], there are vast differences in the various churches of Christianity.

As an example, the [[Baptist]] faith, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Mormonism]], and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] all base their faith on the [[Bible]], but take different views on such things as organization, the necessity of proselytization, the rituals that have to be observed to be a devout Christian, the will of God, and the nature of [[evil]].

However, there are some common divisions that many scholars agree to:

"[[Abrahamic]]", [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religions believe in ONE creator god, prophetes, and an afterlife.  Although [[Judaism]] is traditionally believed to be the oldest of the three main brances, Rabbinical Judaism developped parallel to Christianity. Both stem from the earlier [[Israelite religion]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] -- Christianity owing a lot to Greek and (later) Roman thinking. Although is traditionally defined as arising around 30-40 [[CE]], Christianity itself did not spread and develop into its own culture until centuries later. Abrahamic religions include [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] (which is separated into hundreds of brances), [[Orthodox Christianity]], [[Oriental Christianity]], [[Mormonism]], and [[Islam]] (which has several major branches).

[[Buddhism]] is ultimately derived from the life and teachings of [[Siddhartha Gautama]] (c. [[600 BCE]]), although his teachings did not displace, but instead absorbed, the philosophies of the regions it spread to, providing for a continuence with other earlier faiths.  The three main branches of Buddhism are traditionally regarded as [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]], although some scholars speak of a "fourth Buddhism" coming into existance as the religion is studied in areas politically, geographically, and linguistically distinct from Buddhism's [[India]]n origins.  It also played an important role in [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]]; however, these generally absorbed Buddhists philosophies, not the supernatural or ritual elements of Buddhism.

[[Hinduism]] is a group of distinct but intimately related religions, made possible through the practice of [[henotheism]].  It is sometimes said that there as many forms of Hinduism as there are Hindus; however, the most-worshipped [[trinity]] of gods includes [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]].  It had a strong influence on other Indian religions, including [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].

[[Neopaganism]] (or "[[New Age]]") is a term that was coined to describe the modern trend of new religions which have a strong belief in the [[supernatural]].  Some religions strongly reject the label as it has been used derisively by scholars of other faiths, while some religions accept the label proudly.  These religions are very diverse, from [[doctrine|doctrinal]] to philosophical; some seem to have been created-whole cloth, while others are explicitly based on another religion.  Some of the best known Neopagan religions include [[Asatru]], [[Raelism]], [[Scientology]], [[Tenrikyo]], and [[Wicca]].  [[Unitarian Universalism]] is sometimes considered a Neopagan religion, and sometimes a Judeochristian religion; it merits individual study.
