'''Neoconservatism''' is a political philosophy and ideology which combines many traditional conservative opinions with an emphasis on the importance of foriegn policy and using American power to push democracy forward. This originated in a number of places - liberal anti-Sovietism, strong support for Israel, dissent from the left. The [[University of Chicago]] philosopher [[Leo Strauss]] is seen as one of the foundational figures in pushing forward neoconservatism - believing in ''noble lies'' (religion being a prime example for Strauss) which you can tell to get people to act morally. [[Iraq]] has become the culmination, for many, of neoconservatism.
