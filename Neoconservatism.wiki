'''Neoconservatism''' is a political philosophy and ideology which combines many traditional conservative opinions with an emphasis on the importance of foriegn policy and using American power to push democracy forward. This originated in a number of places - liberal anti-Sovietism, strong support for Israel, dissent from the left. The [[University of Chicago]] philosopher [[Leo Strauss]] is seen as one of the foundational figures in pushing forward neoconservatism - believing in ''noble lies'' (religion being a prime example for Strauss) which you can tell to get people to act morally.

Neoconservatism had become especially influential in the United States of America following the [[9-11 Attacks]]. Their greatest disciples in the [[George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] included the secretary of Defense, [[Donald Rumsfeld]], the Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]] who were all at one time or another members of the neoconservative [[Project for a New American Century]] thinktank. Their influence waned somewhat as the Iraq War dragged on; Rumsfeld is no longer the secretary for defense and Wolfowitz is no longer directly involved in the administration.
