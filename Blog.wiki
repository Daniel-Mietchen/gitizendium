A '''blog''' is a journal site where the blogger (the blog's administrator) posts entries.  Often, entries are displayed in reverse-[[chronological order]].  

==Etymology==
"Blog" is a shortening of "we'''b log'''".  Blog can also be used as a verb to refer to adding an entry about a topic to a blog, as in "I blogged about that".  

==How It Works==
Many bloggers use a [[hosted blogging service]], like [[Blogger]] or [[TypePad]] or [[LiveJournal]], which allow the blogger to get started without installing any software on their computer.  Some of these are ad-supported, and some offer paid ad-free models.

There are also dozens of blogging programs you can install on your own computer, using a personal machine as your blog's server.  These allow the blogger to decide whether or not to allow advertising to cover costs, but makes the blogger responsible for hardware and bandwidth costs.
