'''Police''' are local, regional, or national governmental personnel who are responsible for investigating crimes and arresting criminal suspects, reducing the incidence of criminal acts, managing vehicular traffic and responding to accidents, and a variety of emergency services dependent on local needs and policies. They are principally responsible for domestic criminal matters, although certain police agencies may have anti-terrorist or paramilitary roles.

Again depending on local law and custom, they may operate [[prison]]s, but will almost always have temporary secure holding facilities, often called jails, for suspects.
