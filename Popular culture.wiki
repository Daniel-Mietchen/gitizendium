'''Popular culture''' has been defined in a large number of different ways, but the core essential seem to include an opposition to or polarity with [[high culture]] - either popular culture ends up being the culture of the mass, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[proletariat]], the dismissed culture of ''glitz'' and ''razzle-dazzle''. Popular culture is also thought of as a commercialised [[folk culture]] that has been created as a result of urbanization, the increase in leisure time after [[World War Two]] and [[mass media]]. Another important aspect of popular culture is the fact that it evolves alongside subcultures. For instance, in the commercialisation of [[black culture]] - specifically [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[hip-hop]], [[soul]], [[dance music|dance]] and [[club culture]] - and also of [[punk]] music and fashion.

Popular culture is often traced to a number of sources - the form of the [[operetta]] or [[light opera]], and early [[musical theatre]] like [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], which led on to the development of early film, including the animated shorts and features of [[Walt Disney]]. Similarly, twenieth century popular music combined a mixture of the black influence of [[blues]] and [[jazz]] with that of [[gospel]] music from both black and white ecclesiastical traditions. The invention of the [[Player-Piano]] and then [[radio]] and [[television]] helped shift the culture over to one of mediated experience from live performance to mediated experience.

Many have been critical of popular culture, including the late [[Neil Postman]] who criticised [[television]] in his book [[Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business]], which argued that the format of television reduces the intellectual involvement and attention span of the viewer compared to the reader of a book - and that ideas in [[politics]], [[science]] and [[religion]] are trivialised by the medium.
