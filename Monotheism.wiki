'''Monotheism''' is the belief in the existence of one God. The primary alternatives to monotheism are [[polytheism]] - belief in many gods, [[atheism]] - belief in no gods, or some kind of variation on [[pantheism]] - the belief that the whole universe ''is'' God. [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] are all monotheistic, although it is possible to challenge whether or not the Christian concept of the [[Trinity]] is really monotheistic.

Monotheisms tend to have evolved out of polytheisms: if one looks at the [[Old Testament]], one finds a large variety of rival Gods which aren't denied in the same way that an modern Jew or Christian would deny, say, a Hindu God - no, they are said to exist in some sense, but the worship of them is forbidden ([[henotheism]] or [[monolatrism]]). It is [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] dogma that monotheism, not polytheism, has been around since it was revealed to the earliest man<ref>[[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10499a.htm Monotheism]</ref>.

The earliest monotheism is widely considered to be [[Zoroastrianism]] and the worship of [[Ahura Mazda]].
