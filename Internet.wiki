The '''Internet''' is a "network of [[computer network|networks]]" best known as the global network the [[World Wide Web]] is run on. It is common to call the World Wide Web "the Internet" but this is not accurate. The Web is the Internet's best known and front-facing service; however there are literally hundreds of different [[protocols]], applications and services that run over the Internet.

The first functional networks between individual computers were created in the early 1970s. These networks, however, assumed the computers ran common software and protocols. Some of the networks were proprietary to computer vendors, such as IBM's Binary Synchronous Communications and the 1974 System Network Architecture, Xerox Network Services, Digital Equipment Corporation DECnet. [[X.25]] was a nonproprietary standard, but used a different architecture than would the [[datagram]] networks such as the ARPANET and Internet.


Louis Pozin first introduced the idea of a generalized method of interconnecting networks of computers rather than individual computers, which he termed a '''catenet'''<ref name=Pouzin>{{citation

Such refinement took place under the sponsorship of the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), later renamed the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).  ARPA was formed to meet a number of perceived Cold War technology challenges, and was established in 1958 as the first U.S. response to the Soviet launching of [[Sputnik]]<ref name="DARPA1">{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/body/overtheyears.html|title=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|publisher=United States government|year=2003|accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref>.

Among ARPA's areas of interest was the interconnection of networks, under the management and inspiration of  J.C.R. Licklider 1915-1990<ref>{{citation
 | title = Internet Pioneers: J.C.R. Licklider 
 | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/licklider.html}}</ref>, one of the pioneers of cooperative research. Vint Cerf extended Pouzin's catenet model as the basis for what was to become the [[ARPANET]]:<blockquote>The U.S.
DARPA research project on this subject has adopted the term to
mean roughly "the collection of packet networks which are
connected together."  This is, however, not a sufficiently
explicit definition to determine, for instance, whether a new
network is in conformance with the rules for network
interconnection which make the catenet function as confederation
of co-operating networks.<ref name=CerfIEN48>{{citation

Cerf extended the concept of catenet to be usable in a specific research network, the ARPANET. ARPANET was the first large-scale "network of networks" using common mechanisms to interconnect disparate networks. It was funded through ARPA, and access was limited to selected universities, research organizations, and government agencies. Contrary to widespread legend, it was never intended to be a military network survivable under nuclear attack, although other, not necessarily packet-switching, networks, were intended for warfighting. starting as early as the 1963 SACCS, specific to the [[Strategic Air Command]].<ref name=SAC>{{citation

}}</ref> Other warfighting networks included the even earlier Minimum Essential Emergency Command Network (MEECN), which was made up of multiple networks that were interconnected only through human intervention.<ref name=MinotMEECN>{{citation

Many educational institutions and corporations began joining the network, and in 1983 all nodes on the ARPANET changed over at once to [[Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4), which is still in use on the internet today.  While this is often referred to as "TCP/IP", they are two distinct protocols: [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), and IPv4. In a literal sense the written term TCP/IP can be read aloud as "TCP over IP" and would be a correct description.

There were several intermediate steps between the ARPANET, to which access was strictly controlled, and today's ubiquitous Internet. See [[#History|History]]

While IPv4 will be present indefinitely, it is limited in its capability for modern functions, and an evolution is in process to [[Internet Protocol version 6]] (IPv6). Internally, the Internet is divided into [[Autonomous System]]s, which exchange information about the destinations they can reach, using the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP).

==History==
===1950s to 1970s===
*[[DARPA]]
*[[BBN]] - Bolt, Barenek and Newman
*[[NCP (ARPANET)]]
===1975 to 1980===
*[[Email]] was invented, then shortly thereafter [[Spam]] was invented. Ugh.

===1980 to 1990===
The Internet of the 1980s did not resemble what we know as the Internet today. The concept of a [[web browser]] and [[web pages]] linked together via [[hypertext]] had not been invented yet. Piecemeal protocols were invented to facilitate chat, share files, store and retrieve information.
