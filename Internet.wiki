The '''internet''' is a network of [[computer networks]] used to transport documents over the [[world wide web]].  The research which led to the internet was funded initially by the United States' [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which was established in 1958 as the first U.S. response to the Soviet launching of [[Sputnik]]<ref name="DARPA1">{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/body/overtheyears.html|title=Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|publisher=United States government|year=2003|accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref>.  The first functional networks between individual computers were created in the early 1970's.  Many educational institutions and corporations began joining the network, and on a day in 1983, all computers on the so-called DARPA-net changed over at once to a new [[protocol]], TCP/IP, which is still in use on the internet today.  The fundamental transport [[protocol]] for the internet has not changed substantially in more than twenty years.  However, it is on the verge of changing in the near future, with a movement from version 4 to version 6 of TCP/IP.
