David Hume (April 26, 1711 â€“ August 25, 1776) was a Scottish philosopher, economist, and historian. He is considered one of the most important figures in the history of Western philosophy and the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Although in recent years interest in Hume's work has centred on his philosophical writing, it was as an historian that he first gained recognition and respect.

Hume recognised clearly the difficulties in gaining a general understanding merely by accumulating observations.]]
