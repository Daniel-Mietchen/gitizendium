'''Humanism''' is a group of [[ethics|ethical]] theories that place the human being at the center of our moral concern. It also refers to a literary and scholarly movement during the [[Renaissance]] led by scholars like [[Erasmus]].

Humanists tend to believe that human beings can make progress through the application of human intellect without the need for religious authority, and many also believe that "man is the measure of all things",<ref>Protagoras, 5th century BCE; see also {{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/man-is-the-measure-of-all-things-1 |title=Man is the measure of all things |accessdate=2008-04-02 |format= |work=Proverbs.

Humanism is derived from both [[Unitarian Universalism]] and from the philosophies of the [[Enlightenment]].
