'''Epistemology''' (from Greek ἐπιστήμη, or ''episteme,'' knowledge; and λόγος, or ''logos,'' a study or account) is also called '''Theory of Knowledge.'''  A [[philosophy|philosophical]] discipline, epistemology deals with broad questions: what is [[knowledge]]?  Is [[certainty]] required for knowledge, and what is certainty anyway?  From what sources--[[sense-perception]], say, or [[revelation]]--do we derive knowledge?  Our beliefs can have more or less [[justification]], [[warrant]], or [[evidence]]--and these features seem, roughly speaking, required for knowledge.  So what are they?  Some thinkers doubt that we have any, or very much, knowledge at all.  On what grounds can we embrace, or reject, such [[skepticism]]? Surely if you are intensely thinking that you have no knowledge, that is certainly a contradiction!
